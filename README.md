# coding-challenge
Here host V1 codes of Futurera's coding workshop.

1. The order to complete the tasks, recommended by our questions committees based on the difficulty asc is:
  - PlusOne
  - RemoveAllDuplicatesFromSortedArray
  - BracketMatch
  - BSTIteratorTestRunner
  - MaximumSubarray
  - LFUCacheTestRunner
  - TheSkylineProblem
Please note that the difficulty level may vary from person to person because of the experience and how hard they practice. You may find different difficulty challenges from someone else, or from our recommendation.

2. The exact questions are introduced in the files. Please read the question carefully before you start coding, to make sure you are satisfying the requirement.

3. To reduce the friction for event participants to run the codes, we have put the test cases into the same file where you are going to write your codes to. However it is strongly recoommended that you should not look at the test cases while you are solving the challenges.

4. To test your codes, cd to coding-challenge/src folder, and then:

  - `javac io/futurera/algorithm/{the java file you are going to test}`
  - `java -cp . io/futurera/algorithm/{the class file you are going to test, without file extension)`
  
    The first line compiles the file, while the second line executes the main function in the class. Make sure you have the .(dot) in the right place in the java execution command.
    e.g., to test RemoveFirstDuplicatesFromSortedArray, you need to execute the two commands here:
  
    `javac io/futurera/algorithm/RemoveFirstDuplicatesFromSortedArray.java`
  
    `java -cp . io/futurera/algorithm/RemoveFirstDuplicatesFromSortedArray`
